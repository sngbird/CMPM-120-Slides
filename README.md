# Slide-Show-Prototype

Slideshow for CMPM120

Key Rquirements:
* 3+ scenes - Logo, Game information scene, and a Start Menu (with working buttons that go to scenes that loop back into Start)
* 2+ audio assets - Recorded my cats purring for the logo sound, and the BGM I sampled from a song that was on my computer called "For Mum" By Andrew Applepie using audacity
* 2+ geometric shapes - the menu panes are rectangles that I drew on top of, and the little bubbles leading to the cloud is geometric circles
* 1+ logotype - the writing in my Logo scene
* 1+ multi-line text - the writing in the game information scene
* 1+ Fading animation - most of the scenes fade into eachother.
* 1+ object motion animation - in the game intro scene the cats move into a stack, and in the start menu the thought bubbles appear and then the start menu slides from the left of the screen
